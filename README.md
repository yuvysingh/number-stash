# number-stash

This is the  first game I have made with VANILLA JS 
Here I learnt what the DOM is and how to work with it, how to use event listeners and so on.

In the game the player gets a number and has a choice whether to keep it, this number is added to their total.
The aim is to maximise the total, with the constraint that they can only choose 5 nums or reject 3 nums

I decided to study the stratergies of the game and decided to look into using a static threshold.
This means that one will not stash any number lower than the threshold. 
Then I found and checked that the maximum expectation for the total is of 66.1, which happens with a threshold of 9.
